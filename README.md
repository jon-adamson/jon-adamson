<h1>Hi, I'm Jon! </h1>

I am a data analytics and business strategy enthusiast currently pursuing an M.S. in Business Analytics at Northeastern University. My work bridges the gap between technical analysis and business decision-making, with a focus on solving real-world problems using data.

My projects reflect a strong foundation in Python, Excel, and Power BI, with experience in predictive modeling, survey analysis, and operational optimization. I enjoy translating complex datasets into actionable insights and creating clear, compelling narratives around data.

This GitHub profile showcases my hands-on experience with machine learning, data visualization, and strategic analytics initiatives. I am always looking to improve my skills, contribute to impactful projects, and collaborate with others in the data community.
